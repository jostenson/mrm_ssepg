During reprocessing using this code, it has been found that apparently random variations in the BART image reconstruction occur when the input does not change.
Analysis of these recon. variations in the MR system phantom experiment, reported in the above publication, was performed.
The coefficients of variation of MRF estimated T1 and T2 for all ROIs in the MR system phantom were <= 0.3% for all TBW and crusher combinations and all dictionary types (EPG, pEPG, ssEPG).
As a result of these variations, there may be small (~0.3% or less) differences between the reported MRF T1 and T2 estimates in the manuscript and those generated by this code.
